# tennishots.com

Tennishots.com was an ambitious interactive website get advanced statistical analysis of the data gathered by the Sony Smart Tennis Sensor.

It could even be used to generate video collection of the best shots recorded during play.

I have a physical sciences background, and this project was my first contact with unfamiliar technologies such as `Django`, `Angular`, `TypeScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`.

Looking back, the code is a bit of a mess, and definitely not polished, indicative of the fact that I was learning while doing.

Portions of the tennishots code live on in the official app (and the cloud backend) I created for the [In/Out tennis camera](https://support.inout.tennis/companion-app).

See what Tennishots could do:
